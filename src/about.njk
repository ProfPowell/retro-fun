  <div class="post-body">
    <p>Cyber Viber Ninja is a collection of retro-inspired web experiments — demoscene effects, 8-bit aesthetics, cyberpunk vibes, and creative coding, all built with zero dependencies using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Every demo is self-contained and runs entirely in the browser. No frameworks, no build tools, no npm install. Just open and play.</p>
