## What is this place?

Cyber Viber Ninja is a growing collection of retro web experiments — demoscene effects, 8-bit pixel art, cyberpunk aesthetics, and creative coding demos, all built with zero dependencies.

Every demo runs entirely in the browser using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks. No bundlers. No `npm install`. Just open and vibe.

## What's new

The site just got a big upgrade:

- **Blog** — you're reading the first post right now
- **Navigation** — jump between Latest, Demos, Posts, and About
- **Dates** — every demo now shows when it was added
- **Load More** — the card grid loads incrementally instead of all at once

## What's coming

More demos, more posts, and maybe some write-ups on how specific effects work under the hood.

> "Any sufficiently advanced CSS is indistinguishable from magic." — probably someone

Stay tuned.
